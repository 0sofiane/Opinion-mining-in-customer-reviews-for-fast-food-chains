# Opinion-mining-in-customer-reviews-for-fast-food-chains
This project is divided into two main parts :   
1- In the first one, we are going to conduct a sentiment analysis on customer reviews for famous fast food chains : McDonald’s, Burger King and Subway, based on scraped data from websites, then build sentiment analysis vizualisation compare the three of them.  
2- In the second one, we are going to dig deeper on McDonald’s negative reviews and try to build a linguistic classifier to identify the type of policy that is violated, hence helping the company better understand its customers and improve the quality of its services.
